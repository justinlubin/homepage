      <p>
        As
        <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">
          Elm</a>
        developers, we often hear things like&hellip;
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          &ldquo;First, define your types right; then, the rest of your program
          will follow&rdquo;
        </li>
        <li>
          &ldquo;Use your compiler as an assistant&rdquo;
          <span>
            (with thanks to
              <a href="https://elm-lang.org/news/compilers-as-assistants">
                Evan Czaplicki</a>)
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          &ldquo;Make impossible states impossible&rdquo;
          <span>
            (with thanks to
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8">

          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        &hellip;but what does that look like in practice?

    </section>

    <section id="questions">
      <ul>
        <li>
          How do we actually construct types &ldquo;right&rdquo; in the first
          place?
        </li>
        <li>
          What aspects of the compiler do we really use as an assistant?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I&rsquo;m fascinated by these kinds of questions! If you are too,
        <b>
          you might be interested in participating in an
          <a href="https://cphs.berkeley.edu/">
             IRB</a>-approved
         research study I&rsquo;m running!
        </b>
      </p>

    <section id="participation">
      <p>
        Participation entails installing an editor plugin I made that does
        two things:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          It locally logs all changes that you make to a programming project of
          your choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          It occasionally asks you to use a provided automated tool to redact any
          sensitive information you may have accidentally typed into your editor
          (like a password), then explicitly asks for permission to upload the
          logs to our server.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        These logs will be published publicly for researchers to analyze, which
        we hope will inspire evidence-based developer tooling for languages
        like Elm.

      <h2>About us</h2>

      <p>
        My name is
        <a href="https://jlubin.net">
          Justin Lubin</a>.
        I&rsquo;m a computer science PhD student at UC Berkeley working with my
        advisor, Professor
        <a href="https://schasins.com/">
           Sarah E. Chasins</a>.
        For the past year and a half, I&rsquo;ve been studying how programmers
        write code in statically-typed functional languages like Elm.
        I&rsquo;ve published one
        <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485532">
          paper</a>
        on this work so far (with a
        <a href="https://twitter.com/jplubin/status/1449159815058522115">
          Twitter thread</a>
        and a
        <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485532#sec-supp">
          video</a>,
        too!), and, with this study, I&rsquo;d like to scale up some analyses
        that I previously did by hand.
        This will only be possible with the help of programmers like you, so
        let&rsquo;s make the future of statically-typed functional programming
        even better&mdash;together!
